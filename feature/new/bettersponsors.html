            <h2>Better distinguish sponsored posts in your news feed with this new feature!</h2>
            <p>Currently, Facebook does not clearly label sponsored (ad) content that appears in your news feed from the regular content. A small label is placed where the post date is usually displayed. This label is small and there are no other differences in the appearance of these sponsored posts.</p>
            <p>The Facebook Like Hider add-on changes that.</p>
            <p>Once the new "Better indicators on sponsored posts" setting in the add-on options is enabled, the label for sponsored posts will be modified to include a big blue bar at the top of sponsored posts.</p>
            <img src="../../image/feature/bettersponsor.jpg">
            <p>To access your add-on settings, press the menu button (three lines) in the top-right corner of Firefox. Select Add-ons and click the Facebook Like Hider add-on. Select Options from the tabs listed under the add-on name.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, as of this update (version 3.0), a Facebook Like Hider icon should appear on the right side of your Firefox address bar when you are on the Facebook website. Clicking that button will open the add-on options.</p>
